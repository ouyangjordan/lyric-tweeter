see\nWhen there was no strings to play, you played to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nIn the secret space of dreams, where I dreaming lay amazed\nWhen the secrets all are told, and the petals all unfold\nWhen there was no dream of mine, you dreamed of me"}}, {"title": "California", "album": "Phases", "year": "2013-01-20", "lyrics": "On the way to California\nAnd I don't mean California literally\nI was thinking,

with\nKisses running down my lips\nCould be just a good friend\nWho knows at this point anyway\n\nThere's just something about the way you surrender your eyes\nWithout this barrier of bodies, we'd

the things that we do\nTogether I hope I can be somebody who shows you your heart\nThe way that it weighs upon my own\nIf only we could understand each other, I'd happily die\nOh, I don't care if I spend my whole life away\nI'm gonna try to give to you all of the love that I've been shown before\nCan't wait until tomorrow so that I can know you more\nSo that I can know you more\nSo that I can know you more\nWith all my life, all my might\nTurn all my dark into light\nTake all of the hate in my mind and put it aside\nPut it aside"}}, {"title": "Creator, Destroyer", "album": "Strange Cacti -

late before I know that all\nThe love inside has been empty\nThe world we made has been ending\nAnd like a ghost that hangs around and won't forgive its earthly sins\nI've carried on this love for you\nIt's how my body lives\nMy darling\nHow are you?\nHow have you been lately?\nI only seem to speak to you of superficial things\nCreator, you destroy me\nYou know my hunger well\nAnd yet you starve me\nUntil I'm begging on my knees\nAnd these are a few of very many things\nI can't begin to say out loud\nIf only this song could carry us on\nBut I know I'm only entertaining myself\nI felt that even after I've been stripped of all my pride\nThere still remains a place for you to crawl up inside\nTo crawl up inside\nTo crawl up inside\nAnd I'm out of my mind\nOut of my mind\nMurderous bitch I'm out of my mind\nI'm out of my mind\nTo be in love with you\nThe way that I'm in love with you\nThe way that I'm in love with you\n\nDoot do do do doot doo do do do...\n\nFuck this and

am crying, too\nThe world might be lying\nBut so are you\n\nI can see you dancing\nIf you'd just take the step\nYou might still have it in you\nGive yourself the benefit\nAnd dance slow

\u201cDead and Gone\u201d\u201d of the long-running NBC series Bonanza. In the episode, country-folk legend Hoyt Axton sings a duet with actor Pernell Roberts:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRo5pbgO1jg\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear indication of who wrote \u201cEndless Road\u201d, but it is likely Axton, on whose 1978 album Free Sailin\u2019 the song would later appear. Olsen\u2019s version of the song is included as a bonus track on the deluxe version of her album Burn Your Fire for No Witness. It is near-identical to the original, but with a few minor, incidental changes\u2014the singular \u201cwind\u201d becomes plural, for instance. Accompanied by only a guitar, Olsen\u2019s vocal delivery is more plaintive than that of Hoyt and Pernell, with a haunting rise in urgency or desperation towards the end.\n\nThe song\u2019s relation to American history and music is complex, beyond its concern with the road.

In the episode, country-folk legend Hoyt Axton sings a duet with actor Pernell Roberts:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRo5pbgO1jg\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be a clear indication of who wrote \u201cEndless Road\u201d, but it is likely Axton, on whose 1978 album Free Sailin\u2019 the song would later appear. Olsen\u2019s version of the song is included as a bonus track on the deluxe version of her album Burn Your Fire for No Witness. It is near-identical to the original, but with a few minor, incidental changes\u2014the singular \u201cwind\u201d becomes plural, for instance. Accompanied by only a guitar, Olsen\u2019s vocal delivery is more plaintive than that of Hoyt and Pernell, with a haunting rise in urgency or desperation towards the end.\n\nThe song\u2019s relation to American history and music is complex, beyond its concern with the road. Olsen\u2019s version is a kind of double throwback: the song was first sung in 1965 on a TV western set during and directly after the American Civil War. The lyrics, moreover, echo the 19th century folk song \u201cIn the Pines.\u201d It also echoes several other songs that were recorded after its initial appearence: Dylan\u2019s \u201cAbandoned Love\u201d and \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d (the former recorded in 1975, the latter written and recorded just a few months after the episode aired).

that I roam?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll the places I have been\nKeep calling me back again\nDown in the pines\nI hear the cold winds blow\nMy heart keeps telling me\n\"Footloose and fancy-free\"\nAnd the road goes by\nAnd calls me as it goes\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, maybe somewhere there's a someone\nWaiting there with a smile\nAnd maybe there'll be a place\nTo stop and rest awhile\nAnd maybe you weren't meant to be\nJust a rolling stone\nAnd there's a road to travel on\nThat leads you back to home\n\n[Verse 4]\nOh, but I'll keep travelling on\nKeep looking at the dawn\nTill I can lay this lonesome body down\nAnd when that day has come\nI nevermore will roam\nAnd every road I see will lead me home"}}, {"title": "Enemy", "album": "Burn Your Fire for No Witness", "year": "2014-02-17", "lyrics": "I need

knows the truth of me\n\nAm I the ugly one?\nIt's easy to see past\nAll of the kindness that you've offered me\nIt doesn't last\n\nIt's just a thought I've had\nIf I could show you how\nI came to think this way\nMaybe you'd understand me now\n\nSometimes our enemies\nAre closer than we think\nSometimes the ones we trust\nMay have to give up listening\n\nI wish it were the same\nAs it is in my mind\nI'd lie to learn a thing or two\nGive me a reason why\n\nWhy am I not ashamed?\nWhile I am standing still\nYou want to move in me like you did before\nBut I've had my fill\n\nYou say your time has changed\nThat you have faced defeat\nWe might be older now\nBut is it changing anything?\n\nIt could be in a way\nWe've learned to carry well\nOh how I wish I could\nRemove this doubt I feel

the only one\nWho knows the truth of me\n\nAm I the ugly one?\nIt's easy to see past\nAll of the kindness that you've offered me\nIt doesn't last\n\nIt's just a thought I've had\nIf I could show you how\nI came to think this way\nMaybe you'd understand me now\n\nSometimes our enemies\nAre closer than we think\nSometimes the ones we trust\nMay have to give up listening\n\nI wish it were the same\nAs it is in my mind\nI'd lie to learn a thing or two\nGive me a reason why\n\nWhy am I not ashamed?\nWhile I am standing still\nYou want to move in me like you did before\nBut I've had my fill\n\nYou say your time has changed\nThat you have faced defeat\nWe might be older now\nBut is it changing anything?\n\nIt could be in a way\nWe've learned to carry well\nOh how I wish I could\nRemove this doubt I feel somehow\n\nI want the best for you\nSo I won't look your way\nMaybe the clouds will clear\nAnd I'll be seeing you someday\n\nI wish it were the same\nAs it is in my mind\nI am lighter on my feet\nWhen I've left some things behind"}}, {"title": "Fly on Your Wall", "album": "Phases", "year": "2017-01-20", "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nAt first it wasn't light\nI went along for the ride\nI was a fly on your wall\nTo see the height of it all\n\n[Verse 2]\nI found a feeling inside\nOr should I say it found me\nI turned into someone I\nNever imagined I'd be\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow I just can't take it back\nOr i do anything but that\nTo have the glimpse of the dream\nThe vivid memory\n\n[Outro]\nA love never made is still mine\nA love never made is still mine\nA love never made is still mine\nIf only real in my mind\nIf only real in my mind\nIf only real in my mind", "image": "https://images.genius.com/26512913a421bd3f65d7b96cf83abf88.1000x1000x1.jpg", "artist":

you how it feels\nWhenever you're around\nTake my time with you, my love\nYou're the one I'm thinking of\nYou're the one I'm thinking of\nYou're the one I really love\n\n[Verse 4]\nIn my arms and fast

away\nAnd the truth never really lives\nIn the story of words we say\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou never needed anyone\nTo expose you to yourself\nAnd you never needed anyone\nTo raise you hell out of your mind\nI never wanted to be someone\nWho had to leave it all behind\nEven still there is no escape\nFor what I face, I faced before\nHave whatever love you wanna have\nBut I can't be here

or erase?\n\n[Bridge]\nI've seen you changing\nI've seen you aging\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd I learned how to turn my head\nAnd I learned how to walk away\nAnd the truth never really lives\nIn the story of words we say\n\n[Verse 4]\nYou never needed anyone\nTo expose you to yourself\nAnd you never needed anyone\nTo raise you hell out of your mind\nI never wanted to be someone\nWho had to leave it all behind\nEven still there is no escape\nFor what I face, I faced before\nHave whatever love you wanna have\nBut I can't be here anymore\n\n[Verse 5]\nThere is nothing new\nUnder the sun\nThere is nothing new\nUnder the sun\n\n[Outro]\nHeartache ends\nHeartache ends\nHeartache ends\nAnd begins again\nAnd begins again\nAnd begins again\nHeartache ends\nHeartache ends\nHeartache ends\nAnd

For me, it\u2019s like, \u201cIt sucks because nothing is going your way, and you can\u2019t have everything you want, but then life wouldn\u2019t be life.\u201d\n\nAnd I I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something I\u2019m intending to do. I\u2019m not trying to write like a triumphant work, novel, or album. I\u2019m not trying to write a piece about the human condition. It\u2019s more about my human condition, what I experience in everyday life with my friends, what I\u2019ve seen around me that I\u2019ve somehow found a fault with."}, "comment_count": 0,

school\n\nGoodbye sweet mother earth\nWithout you now I'm a lonely universe\nYou won't always understand\nWhen you've truly loved someone\nUntil after they've gone\n\nThis time of year the nights fall longer\nSo grow a spine or catch cold\nThe winter months they do make you feel stronger\nBut in the end it's all getting old\nAnd you won't always be walking the safest streets\nBut you can find your way home\nIf you have imagined your way back\nThen my dear you're more than halfway there\nAnd you might only possess\nWhat you've carried on your back\nBut you've always been free\nNow it's time to believe\nTime to give up that unforgiving act of altogetherness\nAnd start living out your oldest childhood dreams\nWell, losing your mind it ain't half as bad as it seems\nAnd if you would take the risk\nWell, it might be worth your time\nIt's only your life\nIt's only going by\n\nGoodbye sweet mother earth\nWithout you now I'm a lonely universe\nYou won't always understand\nWhen you've truly

time I was only a child\nAbout to lose my childlike mind\nThe way you touched my hands\nLike you never had before\nIt wasn't you anymore\nI called for my brothers\nI called for my sisters\nBut there was nothing left for them to do\nAnd so I watched from far away\nAs the ambulances came\nAnd started dressing for school\n\nGoodbye sweet mother earth\nWithout you now I'm a lonely universe\nYou won't always understand\nWhen you've truly loved someone\nUntil after they've gone\n\nThis time of year the nights fall longer\nSo grow a spine or catch cold\nThe winter months they do make you feel stronger\nBut in the end it's all getting old\nAnd you won't always be walking the safest streets\nBut you can find your way home\nIf you have imagined your way back\nThen my dear you're more than halfway there\nAnd you might only possess\nWhat you've carried on your back\nBut you've always been free\nNow it's time to believe\nTime to give up that unforgiving act of altogetherness\nAnd start living out your oldest childhood dreams\nWell, losing your mind it ain't half as bad as it seems\nAnd if you would take the risk\nWell, it might be worth your time\nIt's only your life\nIt's only going by\n\nGoodbye sweet mother earth\nWithout you now I'm a lonely universe\nYou won't always understand\nWhen you've truly loved someone\nUntil after they've gone"}}, {"title": "May as Well",

lying\nI don't condemn you for being so wise\nYou've only crossed the line that I'm standing beside\nYou've never held back before\nWhat lover is waiting up for you tonight?\nIs she another in and out of your door?\nWas I another in and out of your door?\n\nDon't stand too close to me, darling\nKeep your hands where I can see\nDon't you know you're wanted in fifty states?\nI love you, dear, but it's not up to me\nAnd it's never quite been, you see\n\n...And some of the things that you've said in my ear\nAs you open a door and casually smile\nHow I have wanted to scream\nOf, of all of the things\nOf all of the things that enter my mind\n\nMy friend, it's hard to see you\nIt's easier to leave you alone\nThere was a time when I needed you more\nMy friend, it's hard to see you\nIt's

goes\nWas a force of its own just passing through\n\nYou can love, you can love, you can lose\nWhen it all looks the same\nYou can love, you can love, you can lose\nEven at your own game\n\nYou can look, you can look, you can see\nWhat you wanted to see\nAll your life you've been looking\nWhatever it is, you don't find it in me\n\nAll your life you've been looking\nWhatever it is you don't find it in me\nAll your life you've been looking\nWhatever it is you don't find it in me\n\nYou don't find it in me\nYou don't find it in me\nYou don't find it in me\nYou don't find it in me"}}, {"title":

have a part\nPlease don't start\nIt hurts to start\nDreaming, dreaming\nOh\nAgain\nAgain\nAgain\n\nAfter it all ends\nWe'll be just like friends\nHey, what was that passing us by?\nHey, it was only something in my eyes\n\nYou can go on home, you got what you need\nTake my heart and put it up on your sleeve\nTear it up so they can all sing along\nLive out your life\nI'll never tell you you're

start\nDreaming, dreaming\nOh\nAgain\nAgain\nAgain\n\nAfter it all ends\nWe'll be just like friends\nHey, what was that passing us by?\nHey, it was only something in my eyes\n\nYou can go on home, you got what you need\nTake my heart and put it up on your sleeve\nTear it up so they can all sing along\nLive out your life\nI'll never tell you you're wrong\nBaby, don't forget, don't forget it's our

me\nIt can slowly turn my blood\nJust as the rings around our ever burning sun\nEventually wilt a once freshly blooming bud\n\n[Chorus]\nIt was all bright, clear\nOh, it was all bright, clear\n\nSuddenly shedding back the years\nAnd after all we soon disappear\nYes, into the dark depths we all soon disappear\nOut of this labyrinth that makes up our world\nHow do we ever know the light inside ourselves?\nTo know that the skin we wear is wrong\nThat we can be anything if we know anything at all\nYes, we can be anything if we know anything at all\n\n[Chorus]\nBright, clear\nAnd

meaning of a love to call my own\nWish it were as easy as just picking up the phone\n\nTime moves so strangely when you're moving all the time\nCan't wait to see you, baby\nWhen it's all through and you're mine\nAll we ever wanted was a heart that kept on trying\nFind myself some magic\nFree us from the thought of dying\n\n[Chorus]\nFeeling kinda tired\nBut I know it's for the best\nEven when you're dreaming, you're not getting any rest\nIn the darker hour when you're far away from home\nNever sure exactly of the last time you were known\nWish it were as easy as just picking up the phone\nWish it were as easy as just picking up the phone\n\nTime moves so strangely when you're moving all the time\nCan't wait to see you, baby\nWhen it's all through and you're mine\nWhen it's all

heteronormative idea of what love is. Angel Olsen (or the song protagonist) experiences an attraction from the initial encounter and through eye contact that shakes her beliefs about who she is and isn\u2019t attracted to.\n\n\u201cAll the truth I thought I learned\u201d is the hegemonic idea of love that was sold to her and has been internalized and possibly a force that keeps her away from exploring who she is. This encounter with this person shakes that basic foundation and at the same time lets her see a truer version of reality and a prettier one with a \u201cbrighter\u201d color that is now in front of her.\n\nThe musical progression of the song also seems to communicate this same sort of shaking and  restructuring feeling. It begins with a slow pace with light percussion but as the realization of attraction towards this woman begins to grow, (and towards the end of the song) the music picks up introducing an electric guitar sound creating a frantic feeling and of chaos.  \u201cAll my life I thought I\u2019d change\u201d is charged with emotion and delivered in a more impactful tone because of the forces pushing her to reject this part of her. But once the protagonist is more at peace with this realization and can focus on the feelings of infatuation and curiosity, \u201call my life I thought I\u2019d change\u201d is delivered with a more

heteronormative idea of what love is. Angel Olsen (or the song protagonist) experiences an attraction from the initial encounter and through eye contact that shakes her beliefs about who she is and isn\u2019t attracted to.\n\n\u201cAll the truth I thought I learned\u201d is the hegemonic idea of love that was sold to her and has been internalized and possibly a force that keeps her away from exploring who she is. This encounter with this person shakes that basic foundation and at the same time lets her see a truer version of reality and a prettier one with a \u201cbrighter\u201d color that is now in front of her.\n\nThe musical progression of the song also seems to communicate this same sort of shaking and  restructuring feeling. It begins with a slow pace with light percussion but as the realization of attraction towards this woman begins to grow, (and towards the end of the song) the music picks up introducing an electric guitar sound creating a frantic feeling and of chaos.  \u201cAll my life I thought I\u2019d change\u201d is charged with emotion and delivered in a more impactful tone because of the forces pushing her to reject this part of her. But once the protagonist is more at peace with this realization and can focus on the feelings of infatuation and curiosity, \u201call my life I thought I\u2019d change\u201d is delivered with a more content tone and reflective looking back at the turmoil that is no longer there."}, "comment_count": 2, "community": true, "custom_preview": null, "has_voters": true, "id": 10191684, "pinned": false,

follow\nMy heart down that wild road\n\nEverywhere I go\nI can see your face\nAlive and gone at once\nHey, that's the way I see this place\nAnd all this blessing was a curse\nBefore I opened up my heart\nYou learn to take it as it comes\nYou fall together, fall apart\n\nI want to know you\nI want to show you\nI want to be there\nI want to see her\nLive it through your eyes\nPiece us

tempered, sick to be tested\nTo see it all clearly, whenever it's rested\nWant every lesson, the lessons they teach me\nSomeone who knows where I am, whenever they reach me\n\nGive me a fever, show me some reason\nLove me whenever it's out of season\nWant to be special, something like your mother\nWant to be someone else, not me, but another\nBut now in this moment, I wish I could meet you\nBut I'm just a balloon, far away, I see you\nI see you\nI see you\n\nI see you, and it's unclear\nI need you to show you're here\nTell me, I'm nothing to fear\nTell me, I'm nothing, nothing"}}, {"title":

through\nIt's just left me and it's just left you\nOn your own\nOn your own\n\nAnd I love you most\nI love you most\nWhen I first found love in my soul\nAnd I'll give to you\nGive it up to you\nWhen I first find it in myself\nAnd the time will come for everyone\nFor everyone to know\nYes the time will come for everyone\nFor everyone to go\n\nAnd say goodbye\nAnd say goodbye\nAnd say goodbye\nSweet

they start rushing to my door\nSomeone to run not walk\nOh, someone to sing not talk\nOh, no hesitation at all\nSometimes I need you to be the one to call\n\nWell I'm lost in my thoughts\nThey tumble ahead\nOver and over again\nYeah it's true\nJust take a look at what's been done to me\nI've wasted time to ponder\nHere I am now all Alice in Wonder\nPartly I do this to myself, but why can't you see\nThe gesture is small, but know that it means the world to me\nOh, forgive me for wanting, I'm only learning\nI've forgiven myself now, there's no returning\nI want to be the one who knows the best way\nI want to be the one who knows the best way\nI want to be the one who knows the best way to love you\n\nBut now I'm foolishly waiting for\nSomeone not thinking before they start rushing to

realize and make you realize\nAnd then realize\n\n[Verse 2]\nBut I'll take all of it\nDon't want to leave it behind\nI'll take all of it\nIf it's only real in my mind\nReal in my mind\nReal in my mind\n\n[Verse 3]\nWill you ever\nWill you ever know the same love that I've known?\nWill you ever\nWill you ever know the same love that I've known?\nWill you ever\nWill you ever know the same love that I've known?\nLove you love you love you\nEven if it's all on my own\nAll on my own\n\n[Refrain]\nDo you remember the way that it used to be?\nI waited for you\nYou kept on searching with

you out toward the sun\nNow that the season's begun\nTo lift these shadows from your heart\nTo shine a lightness in your dark\n\nI'm looking out for the tiniest life\nI'll be looking out for the

to say\nThat I could never lose sight of what my heart truly is\nBut the moment you step away I am forced to look in and face\nAll the things that I have ever been without you\nIt is true at times one can see I am strong\nI am not at home, yet I know where I belong\nI am silence now, but I am always song\nCan you hear me?\n\nI thought this time last year I'd be dead\nIt's quite strange the thoughts that pop into your head\nWhen you're busy smiling surrounded by your closest of friends\nIt is impossible to escape the sound\nOf the dark that is following around\nBut I just go for a walk in my mind and the light can be found\nAnd the moment I step away\nYou are forced to look in and face\nAll the things that you've ever been without me\nIt is true at times one can see you are strong\nYou are not
